So you've got an awesome idea to throw into Ardhat. Great! Head over to [the forum](/community) and let us know!


Updating Documentation
----------------------

We want the Ardhat documentation to be the best it can be. We've
open-sourced our docs and we welcome any pull requests if you find it
lacking.

You can find the documentation for Ardhat in the
[site]({{ site.repository }}/tree/master/site) directory of
Ardhat's repo on GitHub.com.

All documentation pull requests should be directed at `master`. Pull
requests directed at another branch will not be accepted.


Finally...
