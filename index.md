For makers, educators and experimenters worldwide, the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-is-a-raspberry-pi/) has quickly become the compact computing platform of choice for those eager to create, learn and develop for the expanding universe of connected devices. 

With analogue sensors and 5V PWM, UI controls and supply monitoring, LiPo and automotive voltage operation, the standard Ardhat is the missing link that connects the Raspberry Pi with the Real World.  If you need more, the Ardhat-I adds a 10-DOF IMU, and Ardhat-W adds a LoRa ISM wireless node with up to 10km range.

This repository is your goto resource for everything Ardhat, from pinouts to language bindings and everything in between.
